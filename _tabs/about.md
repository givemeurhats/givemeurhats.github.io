# 👋 Hi!
I'm Eric, a software engineer who tinkers with cybersecurity and scalable production environments. I like diving into new tech, breaking things, and figuring out how they work.  
I started this blog to keep track of my setups, experiments, and anything interesting I run into—whether it’s a cool configuration, a weird bug, or just a random hack.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/givemeurhats).
